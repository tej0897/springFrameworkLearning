// Creating Book, Author based Spring Project

Creation flow:


    * Created two classes 1. Book 2. Author
    * Marked class as entity
    * Creating relation between Book and Author. (Many to Many) An author can have many books and Many books will have an author.
    * Check Equality in Hibernate and adding ToString to both Author and Book.
