// Creating Book, Author based Spring Project

Creation flow:


    * Created two classes 1. Book 2. Author
    * Marked class as entity
    * Creating relation between Book and Author. (Many to Many) An author can have many books and Many books will have an author.
    * Check Equality in Hibernate and adding ToString to both Author and Book.
    * Creating a bidirectional relation between a publisher and a book
    * Publisher can publish many books, a book will have one publisher.

    to access or see the H2 Database in picture (like MySQL),
    1. go to application.properties and set the following: // when devTools is not installed.

    (url=jdbc:h2:mem:5c85a85b-7351-4778-828b-e90fce7a4b6f)
